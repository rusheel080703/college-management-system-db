You are a database designer. Create a detailed ER diagram for a small college, including 15 entities and their relationships.  

1. Core 9 entities:
   - Student
   - Professor
   - Class
   - School
   - Department
   - Course
   - Room
   - Enroll
   - Building

2. Additional 6 entities:
   - Library
   - Hostel
   - Club
   - Staff
   - Event
   - Cafeteria

3. Include "attributes" for each entity. Examples:
   - Student: student_id, name, dob, email, phone
   - Professor: prof_id, name, department_id, email
   - Course: course_id, name, department_id, credits
   - Class: class_id, course_id, professor_id, schedule
   - Room: room_id, building_id, capacity
   - Enroll: enroll_id, student_id, class_id
   - Library: library_id, name, location
   - Hostel: hostel_id, name, capacity
   - Club: club_id, name, description
   - Staff: staff_id, name, role, department_id
   - Event: event_id, name, date, location
   - Cafeteria: cafeteria_id, name, menu

4. Define "relationships" with cardinality. Examples:
   - Student ENROLLS_IN Class (many-to-many)
   - Professor TEACHES Class (one-to-many)
   - Course BELONGS_TO Department (many-to-one)
   - Class HELD_IN Room (many-to-one)
   - Room LOCATED_IN Building (many-to-one)

   - Club ORGANIZES Event (one-to-many)
   - Staff WORKS_AT Cafeteria (many-to-one)
   - Library MANAGED_BY Staff (many-to-one)

5. Output **only in Mermaid syntax**, in the format:

```mermaid

    Entity1 {
        attribute1
        attribute2
    }
    Entity2 {
        attribute1
    }
    Entity1 ||--o{ Entity2 : "relationship"
