# 🎓 College Management System Database Blueprint (LLM-Assisted Design)

This repository provides the detailed Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram and data model for a comprehensive **College Management System (CMS)**. The system models key aspects of academic, administrative, and extracurricular college operations.

The final diagram serves as a robust blueprint for implementing the college's relational database.

---

## ⚙️ Methodology: Multi-LLM-Assisted Design

The ER diagram was generated using an innovative multi-LLM workflow to ensure accuracy and comprehensive coverage of the database requirements.

### 1. LLM Workflow Tools
The design process was automated using a Streamlit application (`invokeMultipleLLMs.py`) that leverages **LiteLLM** to compare outputs from multiple LLMs running via **Ollama**.

* **Primary Tool:** **Llama 3** (via Ollama)
* **Secondary Tool:** **Gemma 2:2B** (via Ollama)
* **Visualization:** The output was rendered visually using **Mermaid.js** syntax.

***Llama 3 provided the most accurate and usable ER diagram syntax.***

### 2. The Prompt
The full detailed instructions given to the LLMs are available in `Prompt Text.txt`:

* **Goal:** Create a detailed ER diagram for a small college, including 15 entities and their relationships.
* **Entity Count:** 15 total entities (9 core academic, 6 operational).
* **Requirements:** Must include attributes and define relationships with cardinality.
* **Output Constraint:** Output **only in Mermaid syntax**.

## 📊 Data Model: Entities & Relationships

The final data model comprises **15 core entities**, defining attributes and cardinality relationships between them.

### Core Entities
| Entity | Key Attributes |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Student** | student\_id, name, dob, email, phone |
| **Professor** | prof\_id, name, department\_id, email |
| **Course** | course\_id, name, department\_id, credits |
| **Enrollment** | enrollment\_id, student\_id, course\_id, grade\_point\_average |
| **Department** | dept\_id, dept\_name |
| **Hostel** | hostel\_id, name, capacity |
| **Staff** | staff\_id, name, department\_id, role |

### Key Relationships
| Relationship | Cardinality | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Student ENROLLS\_IN Enrollment** | One-to-Many (`||--o{`) | Models student registration for courses. |
| **Professor TEACHES Course** | One-to-Many (`||--o{`) | Links professors to the courses they instruct. |
| **Hostel HOUSES Student** | One-to-Many (`||--o{`) | Assigns students to residence halls. |
| **Staff MANAGES Cafeteria/Library** | One-to-Many (`||--o{`) | Defines administrative oversight for facilities. |

## 🚀 How to Run the LLM Comparison Tool

The `invokeMultipleLLMs.py` script allows you to test multiple LLMs with a single prompt simultaneously.

### Prerequisites
1.  **Install Ollama** and the required models (Llama 3, Gemma 2:2B):
    ```bash
    ollama run llama3
    ollama run gemma2:2b
    ```
2.  **Python Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    # Includes Streamlit, LiteLLM, and PyTorch (for optional GPU detection)
    pip install streamlit litellm torch
    ```

### Execution
Run the Streamlit application from your terminal:
```bash
streamlit run invokeMultipleLLMs.py
