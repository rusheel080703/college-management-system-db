# 🎓 College Management System Database Blueprint

### Project Overview

This repository presents the detailed Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram and data model for a comprehensive College Management System (CMS). [cite_start]The system models key aspects of academic, administrative, and extracurricular college operations[cite: 2, 3].

The diagram serves as a robust blueprint for implementing the college's relational database.

### ⚙️ Methodology: LLM-Assisted Design

[cite_start]The ER diagram was generated using a multi-LLM workflow to ensure accuracy and comprehensive coverage of the requirements[cite: 4, 7].

* [cite_start]**Primary Tool:** Llama 3 via Ollama[cite: 4, 7, 8].
* [cite_start]**Secondary Tool:** Gemma 2:2B via Ollama[cite: 4, 7].
* [cite_start]**Visualization:** The output was rendered visually using **Mermaid.js**[cite: 7].

[cite_start]*(Note: While both LLMs were tested, Llama 3 provided the most accurate and usable ER diagram syntax[cite: 4, 8]. The full prompt used is available in `Prompt Text.txt`.)*

### 📊 Data Model (Entities & Relationships)

[cite_start]The system is modeled using 15 core entities, defining attributes and cardinality relationships between them[cite: 5, 6].

#### Core Academic Entities (9)
| Entity | Attributes Example |
| :--- | :--- |
| [cite_start]**Student** | student\_id, name, dob, email, phone [cite: 5] |
| [cite_start]**Professor** | prof\_id, name, department\_id, email [cite: 15] |
| [cite_start]**Course** | course\_id, name, department\_id, credits [cite: 5] |
| [cite_start]**Enrollment** | enrollment\_id, student\_id, course\_id, grade\_point\_average [cite: 17] |
| [cite_start]**Department** | dept\_id, dept\_name [cite: 16] |

#### Operational Entities (6)
* [cite_start]**Hostel:** hostel\_id, name, capacity [cite: 5, 19]
* [cite_start]**Library** [cite: 6]
* [cite_start]**Club** [cite: 6]
* [cite_start]**Staff** [cite: 6]
* [cite_start]**Event** [cite: 6]
* [cite_start]**Cafeteria** [cite: 6]

#### Key Relationships Examples
| Relationship | Cardinality | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Student ENROLLS\_IN Enrollment** | [cite_start]Many-to-Many [cite: 6] | Models student registration for courses. |
| **Professor TEACHES Course** | [cite_start]One-to-Many [cite: 6] | Links professors to the courses they instruct. |
| **Hostel HOUSES Student** | [cite_start]One-to-Many [cite: 6, 22] | Assigns students to residence halls. |
| **Staff MANAGES Cafeteria & Library** | [cite_start]Many-to-One [cite: 6, 22] | Defines administrative oversight. |
